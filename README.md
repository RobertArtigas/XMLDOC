# XMLDOC


This Clarion template was found a while back out in internet land. The original author is given credit even though he has not been around, and I have maintained it up-to-date through Clarion releases. It provides an XML dump of the dictionary and XML dump of the application based on the internal structures used by the template language.

This is very useful in a number of points, it provides understanding of the internal field definitions, it allows you to find some of the more obscure definitions that are not commonly used in the DCTX definition, it provides some context where things do NOT match what you know, and it provides a reference to what is NOT showing because of some default or the field being blank or zero.

There is also NO create APX utility since that is a slightly more complicated endeavor, and this can give you some insight on how things are tied together between the DCTX and a possible APPX.
